# Description

These files give easy commands to use with bash for example when working on the command line 'c' to clear everything 
was useful as well as 'gs' instead of git status. This made working better and more efficient. The script allows
you to download everything very easily without having to do it 1 by 1. Instead you just do './script' and it will setup
everything.
